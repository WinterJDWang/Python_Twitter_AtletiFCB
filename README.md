I collected all the tweets containing the string #AtletiFCB and the time frame for download is from 7:00PM to 8:45PM in Spain time, which is from about 15 minutes after the game' start(I expected to capture the data before the game started, but I got a wrong time), to about 15 minutes after the end of the game. During this time, **82,823 tweets** were collected in JSON format and stored in a file called 'AtletiFCB.json', making for about **400Mb** of data."
